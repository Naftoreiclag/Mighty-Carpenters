Each joint can only connect to certain things based on the color of that joint.
A joint can only connect to another joint if that joint is of a "higher" or "lower" color.

For example, a red joint can only connect to a orange, purple, or white joint. It cannot connect to a blue or green joint.

The core should have a gray joint. That means everything can connect to it.

Blue: construction
Yellow: peripheral/output
Red: logic/input

A joint that is a secondary color can have either of the two primaries attached, but not another secondary piece.

That way, in order to attach a logic part, you must put down a blue piece with 2

===========

Maybe instead I should make it so blue can only connect to blue.. and so on
