Essential stuff to set the standard:
===

Energy Unit: Zing
Definition: 1 Zing = Amount of energy to smelt 1 object in a vanilla furnace
(e.g. 1 bucket of lava = 100 Zing)

Metals:
- Copper
- Tin
- Bronze
- Silver
- Lead
- Nickel
- Steel
- Osmium
- Tungsten

Every metal needs an ore*, ingot, dust, quarter-dust, and nugget form.

Metal -> Dust
1 ore -> 2 dust max

Other raw minerals:
- Stone dust (macerated stone/gravel)
- Sawdust (macerated wood)
- Silicon (sand cooked in super-hot furnace)
- Power Ingot (redstone dust in super-hot furnace)
- Bronze (3 copper, 1 tin) gives 4 or (dust alternative) gives 4
- Steel (1 iron, 1 coal/charcoal in super-hot furnace)

Wires:
- Poor Man's Wire = (3 vertical copper ingots) gives 9
  - Transmits up to 0.1 Zing/sec
- Hobbyist's Wire = (3 Poor Man's Wire) gives 1 (this means that 3 copper gives 3 wire)
  - Transmits up to 1 Zing/sec
- Professional Wire = (3 vertical silver ingots, 3 vertical power ingots) gives 3
  - Transmits up to 10 Zing/sec
- Industrial Wire = (3 Professional Wire, 3 gold) gives 3
  - Transmits up to 100 Zing/sec
- Futuristic Wire = (3 Industrial Wire, 3 Osmium, 1 Circuit) gives 3
  - Transmits up to 1000 Zing/sec

Circuits:
- Basic Circuit = (3 Redstone Dust, 3 Paper, 3 Hobbyist's Wire or better)
- Better Circuit = (1 Basic Circuit or 3 Hobbyist's Wire or better, 3 Power Ingot, 3 Silicon)
- Best Circuit = (1 Better Circuit, 3 Professional Wire or better, 1 Diamond)
Downgrading through the teirs will give you 2 for 1

"Tech Parts"
- Pile o' Screws = (1 tin, 1 copper, 1 bronze)
- Pile o' Gears = (1 pile o' screws, 1 iron, 1 lead, 1 nickel)
- Pile o' Springs = (1 pile o' gears, 1 gold, 1 silver, 1 tungsten)
- Big Pile o' Screws = 2 Pile o' Screws
- Big Pile o' Gears = 2 Pile o' Gears
- Big Pile o' Springs = 2 Pile o' Springs
Downgrading through the teirs will give you 2 for 1

Other stuff:
- Light Bulb = (1 tungsten ingot + 1 glass block)

Machines
- Burning Generator = (1 furnace or 1 iron ingot, 1 iron block, 1 basic circuit)
- Super-hot Furnace = (8 brick blocks, 1 Pile o' Gears)
  - Uses gunpowder and blaze powder (at once) as fuel
  - Used to make alternate cooking recipies
- Rock Tumbler = (1 cauldron, 2 Pile o' Gears, 4 Pile o' Screws)
  - Combines Flint and an Ore to make 1 1/4 pile of dust
- Macerator = (1 Rock Tumbler, 1 Basic Circuit, 1 Pile o' Gears, 3 Hobbyist's Wire or better)
  - Uses 2 Zing to make 1 1/2 dust per ore
- Macerator II = (1 Macerator, 3 Professional Wire)
  - Uses 2 Zing to make 2 dust per ore
- Zing Furnace = (1 Furnace, 1 Basic Circuit, 1 Pile o' Gears, 3 Hobbyist's Wire or better)
- Super-hot Zing Furnace = (1 Super-hot Furnace or 1 iron block, 3 Industrial Wire)
  - Uses 4 Zing to make 1 next-grade item
